# SWE Guidelines

This is the source code for the SWE Guidelines book, an open-source guide our software engineering best practices. 
This guide is a work in progress and we welcome contributions. If you have suggestions or improvements, please submit a pull request.


## Getting Started

To build the book, you will need to have mdBook installed. If you don't have it, you can install it with:
```bash
cargo install mdbook
```

Then you can serve the book on `http://localhost:3000`:
```bash
mdbook serve
```
